    new policies with kind *z3* that will be executed with Microsoft z3 state
    of the art automatic theorem prover.
issues:
  - |
    Support of z3 is still preliminary. No built-ins are supported yet.

    z3 must be installed separately. This can be done by devstack if ``ENABLE_CONGRESS_Z3``
    is set to true.
